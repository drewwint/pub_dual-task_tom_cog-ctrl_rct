This file contants the code and images for the task

The images for the [CAToon task](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2021.100959) need to be accessed from the authors at [their lab](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience/downloads/catoon.html)
- they have the resized resized used in this application of the task
- **NOTE** there will be no /stimuli folders in these tasks because you need to grab these from the authors above - when you use these you will need to add the /stimuli folder yourself

Task is coded in in python using [psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) and was hosted in [pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/).
- we post all 4 varaitions of the task for test and control conditions with two for each representing counterballanced ordering.
